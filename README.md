# Major-Adverse-Cardiovascular-Events
Discussion to formulate Code List that can be utilised to identify patients that have had a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) following a medical intervention (excluding caridac surgery and coronary stenting). There has been an increasing number of papers reporting MACE as a outcome measure. This includes with trial research, audits or review and meta-analysis. Yet, in the literature there is a high degree of heterogeneity around the definition of MACE. 

A recent meta-analysis by Bosco et al., (2021) identified that numerous terms are included within different authors definitions, often as a composite outcome.

The conditions often reported include:
-Acute Myocardial Infarction
-Acute coronary syndrome / ischaemic heart disease
-Stroke
-Heart Failure
-All-cause death
-CV death
-Revascularisation

These conditions are then reported in varying combinations.
